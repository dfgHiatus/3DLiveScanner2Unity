# 3DLiveScanner2Unity
3DLiveScanner to Unity Blender addon - https://gist.github.com/dfgHiatus/26530dfffa7b44711ad70caea473fd20

A reupload of this, in case I want to work on it more. If you want to use it yourself (for the time being):
1) Create a new material called 'Vertex Color'
1) Drop the python script into a new scripting tab, then click run. This will generate a UI
1) Fill out the parameters. Input should point to a directory of obj's
1) Open the Blender system console to monitor progress
1) Run!
